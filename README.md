# OpenCV XCFramework

![[Pipeline status](https://ci.younata.com/teams/main/pipelines/opencv)](https://ci.younata.com/api/v1/teams/main/pipelines/opencv/badge)

Currently, the [OpenCV project](https://github.com/opencv/opencv) does not provide xcframeworks to download. Which makes it super annoying to develop mac apps that use opencv.

This project exists to provide xcframeworks for opencv.
